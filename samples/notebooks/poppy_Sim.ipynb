    "The Poppy Right Arm is a project that is focused on modeling the effects of toy interaction on infant development.\n",
    "For example, if given a rattle to shake, how does an infant develop motor skill such as rhythm? Are there any effects on an infants reactionss to sounds in general, and perhaps is there any effect on early language development? All of these questions are relevent to this project.\n",

    "This version of the notebook is for working with the V-rep simulator.\n",
    "A scene for the poppy right arm has not been developed yet, so using the stationary poppy humanoid is needed in its place.\n",
    "As the physical robot can only have sensor data collected from the joints via sensors on the motor, this is useful for modeling the specifics of the hand rather than the rist in spatial relativity tothe head.\n"
